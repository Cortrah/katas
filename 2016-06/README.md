## Description

    What's REST Games?
    
    Welcome to REST Games! Our goal is to provide you some
    coding challenges that go beyond the katas. You will 
    implement a small JSON REST API that will play a well
    known game. The cool part comes when two mates develop
    the same JSON REST API and a Referee can make them play 
    one against the other. Cool, isn't it?
